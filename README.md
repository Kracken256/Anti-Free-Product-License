# Anti-Free-Product-License (AFPL)
This is a collection of Software/Product LICENSEs for Copyright holders.

These LICENSEs essentially grant "God" like powers to the Copyright holder, such as being able to revoke (change their mind without reason) about anything they say. The AFPLs also allow the Copyright holder to amend the LICENSE at any time. So if the copyright holder wants to take it closed source (completely), they can issue an amendment stating they are revoking ALL rights for ALL parties to possess the source code. This can be done universally or on a party-to-party basis.

For anyone that wants to "Promote freedom of whatever" or "Protect the freedom and access to software for all" and believes that software Patents should be illegal or whatever it may be, then you probably should not use a LICENSE like these. Otherwise if you are the American capitalist that believes in "Hard word = Reward Profit" AND you want to protect your work from the PUBLIC DOMAIN then this may be right for you.

To point out, this LICENSE has yet to be tested in court. So I don't know if it will actually hold up in court. As it seems, though, these LICENSEs aren't any more restrictive than those used by Big corporations that own proprietary systems such as operating systems (There are two I a talking about). Those used by big companies can be formally amended and changed (to some extent). In addition, special permissions can be granted or revoked to certain parties, mainly at the company's discretion.

I am not an attorney or anyone claiming to be like an attorney. As stated in the LICENSE of this repository, I don't accept any liability from anyone.
